/**
 * modules.css (Keep this file empy, it will not be included)
 *
 * Modules sit inside Layout components or other Modules.
 *
 * - Each module has its own stylesheet
 * - A module should be designed to exist as a standalone component
 * - Use class names only
 * - Use descendent or child selectors to only affect surrounding elements (let styles affect the module only and not cascade/bleed out to other parts)
 * - No use of ID's
 * - No use of element selectors
 * 	- Only include a selector that includes semantics (a span or div holds none, a class does)
 * - No use of !important
 *
